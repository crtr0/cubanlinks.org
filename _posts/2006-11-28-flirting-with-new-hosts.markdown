<p>Today I coughed-up $240 or so for 1-year of <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com">DreamHost</a> hosting. I have been using <a href="http://www.textdrive.com">Textdrive</a> for the past 9 months or so, and have become increasingly frustrated (MySQL crashes, sporadically sluggish performance, and high prices).</p>


<p>The straw that broke my back was my inability to add a new domain without coughing up more money. I already pay $60/month for business-class hosting (ha) and am limited to <strong>5 domains</strong>. Simply ridiculous.  So, here&#8217;s what I get for roughly $20/month with DH:</p>


<ul>
<li>Storage: 400 GB</li>
	<li>Bandwidth/month: 4TB</li>
	<li>Databases: <strong>unlimited</strong></li>
	<li>Domains: <strong>unlimited</strong></li>
	<li>Custom <span class="caps">DNS</span>: included</li>
</ul>


<p>I won&#8217;t bother to list everything else, those are the key points to me. I&#8217;ll also be completely honest: <em>none of this mean anything if the performance sucks</em>. I will be evaluating DH quite a bit over the next couple of weeks. At the moment I&#8217;ve spent an entire day failing to get RubyOnRails/FastCGI working properly. So, I&#8217;m not getting too excited yet. But I am hoping for better things.</p>
