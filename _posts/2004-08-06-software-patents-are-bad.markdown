<p><a href="http://www.binarybits.org/bitbucket/2004/07/why_id_like_to_.html">Timothy thinks software patents are a bad idea</a> and I wholeheartedly agree.  Sometimes when I sit back and reflect on all of the injustices I see around me every day (RIAA, <span class="caps">MPAA</span>, etc), and the lack of public outcry, I realize something: &#8220;Joe Public&#8221; is <b>years</b> behind the curve.  Whenever I try to explain these issues to my parents or even my own friends, their eyes start to glaze over.  And thus the parallel between the threat of patent lawsuits and mafia &#8220;protection&#8221; schemes is lost on them.  One group who understands the harmful effects of this <b>gap</b> is <a href="http://creativecommon.org">CreativeCommons</a> who do a great deal to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/">educate people</a> about IP issues in a way anyone can understand.</p>
