<p>Against all odds, I passed the <span class="caps">BEA</span> Weblogic Developer certification exam this morning with a score of 77 (66 needed to pass).  Words can&#8217;t express the relief I felt after I got my score.  What does passing this test actually mean?  I&#8217;m not sure.  Something.</p>
