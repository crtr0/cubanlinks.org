<p>My Linux server is pimp-slapping me around like a nickel ho.  I tried to upgrade my <a href="http://www.openssh.org" title="OpenSSH">OpenSSH</a> installation to 3.6.1.  My previous install was 3.0.1, and was woefully out of date.  So, I install the new <span class="caps">SSH</span> binaries and reboot my computer.  <br/><br/>
Naturally, everything explodes.  Despite my money start-up scripts, <b>nothing comes up</b> (save httpd).  My box is hosted out at my buddy&#8217;s hosting facility and I was forced to wait for him to schlep out to some random building and find out what was wrong.  He logs-on and discovers that my <span class="caps">SSH</span> install is a shambles, and for some reason will not authenticate users.
<br/><br/>
Anyway, my system has been down for hours at this point, so I ask him to start-up my vital services (SMTP, <span class="caps">IMAP</span>, and <span class="caps">HTTP</span>) and promise to come over myself tomorrow morning and fix the rest.  What a <em>show</em>.</p>
