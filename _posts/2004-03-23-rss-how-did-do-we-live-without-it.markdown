<p><b>The series of events:</b>
<ul>
<li>My <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">news aggregator</a> tells me that <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Dave&#8217;s site</a> has a new post (several actually). My aggregator is web-based, and automatically refreshes the page to alert me of new posts.</li>
<li><a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2004/03/23#When:11:43:26AM">He mentions</a> that Harvard is holding a <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/ilaw">Internet law conference</a> this May.  The cost is <em>$2000</em> but bloggers who have an interest in Internet law (me) may apply for a fee-waiver (scholorship).</li>
<li>I send in an email, crossing my fingers.</li>
</ul>
The odds of this happening a few years ago would have been slim.  Everything would have hinged on browsing Dave&#8217;s site just as the post went up, so that I might notice it sitting at the top of the page.  The ineffiencies of the past are staggering.<br/><br/>
And it doesn&#8217;t stop with blogs.  Why isn&#8217;t <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> offer a feed for new products (maybe by category)?  How great would it be to know (immediately) when a new cell phone or <span class="caps">MP3</span> player is being offered for sale?  How can these features not exists already?

<i>Update:</i> <a href="http://www.onfocus.com/index.asp?xml=2003_07_01_past.xml#3268">Here is a way to obtain <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds for Amazon products sorted by sales rank or date</a>. <a href="http://www.onfocus.com">[onfocus.com]</a>.</p>
