<p><a href="http://blog.topix.net/archives/000016.html">A very thought-provoking look into Google&#8217;s technology and where it might take them.</a>  I&#8217;m a strong believer in the inevitable migration away from pure desktop applications to internet-enabled applications, and it seems like Google may be poised to be a dominant player in that space in the future.
<br/><br/>
Of course, people (Sun, Oracle, etc) have been saying this for years, and many attempts at pure thin-clients have failed.  What they never understood is that the best internet applications (or services) work in <em>conjunction</em> with desktop apps. Examples:<br/>
<ul>
<li>CD Player programs + <span class="caps">CDDB</span></li>
<li>iTunes + the online music store</li>
<li>Email client + <span class="caps">LDAP</span> address book</li>
<li>Windows + Software Updates service</li>
<li>Quicken + banking services</li>
</ul>
The list goes on, and the line between local functionality and network services are getting blurred.  And this isn&#8217;t just a cool technical idea, with no relation to customer demand.  Every day I wish for a way to consolodate personal information (addresses, emails, credit cards, medical info) and have it be available <b>in a secure fashion</b> to the applications I&#8217;m using or the vendors (stores, doctors, etc) that I&#8217;m interacting with.  And I know I&#8217;m not alone.  The companies who can provide this service will be <em>sitting on a gold mine</em>.</p>
