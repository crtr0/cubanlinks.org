<p>I recently set-up <a href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/">AWStats</a> to analyze my mail logs.  I&#8217;ve had sporadic problems with my mail server (people not recieving emails I&#8217;ve sent, emails to me getting lost, etc) and I decided I need to keep a closer eye on it.  Anyway, after 2+ days of analysis it seems that 7 out of 604 emails failed to transmit successfully.  That&#8217;s about 1.1%.  Is this acceptable? Terrible?  I have no idea, but I&#8217;m definitely going to start poking around to see what&#8217;s wrong.  In my naive mind, <b>zero</b> failed emails should be the goal.</p>
