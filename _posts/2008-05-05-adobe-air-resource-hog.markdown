<p>I noticed this with AlertThingy, and now I&#8217;m noticing it with Twhirl.  I&#8217;m curious what other people are experiencing: are Adobe Air applications resource hogs?</p>


<p>Btw, I was using Twirl because I found out (belatedly) that they&#8217;ve added FriendFeed support.  Thought I&#8217;d see how I liked the UI compared to AT.  The jury&#8217;s still out.</p>
