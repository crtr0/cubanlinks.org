<p>I got playback working today!  So, at this point in my application you can drill down to music by selecting an artist, selecting an album, and then selecting a track.  Selecting a track will spawn your Mp3 player and open up a stream to the computer that is hosting the music.  Very cool.  It would have been cooler if my Muse.net agent (running on my home computer, where all of my Mp3&#8217;s are) hadn&#8217;t crapped out on me.  Might be time to look for some updated software&#8230;.</p>
