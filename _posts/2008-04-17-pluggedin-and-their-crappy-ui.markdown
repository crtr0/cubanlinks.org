<p>I got really excited when I heard about <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/080416/p14#a080416p14">PluggedIn</a>, a site that wants to be the Hulu.com of music videos.  Uh, not quite.  Not only do you have to install a plug-in to watch the videos (A Java applet? What is this, 1999?) but their catalog of videos is weak and their UI is terrible.  See the screen-shot below.  Don&#8217;t these web-designers know that stretching photos is not cool?  Look at poor Akon, he&#8217;s like a rapping dwarf.  And check-out that classy ad for Amy Whinehouse ringtones.  Niiiice!</p>
