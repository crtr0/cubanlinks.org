<p>My email is currently down.  The problems I was having on my Linux box have not gone away, and as a result I&#8217;ve had to shut down my mail server.  My friend Mark (who is hosting my box) is looking into it, but things don&#8217;t look good.  Looks like it&#8217;s been hacked in to.
<br/><br/>
So, my naive view of the world on-line has been shattered.  Spam, viruses, trojan horses, and hacking-in-general have been introduced into my life in a harsh way.  Long term this is a valuable lesson to learn.  At the moment it couldn&#8217;t come at a worse time.</p>
