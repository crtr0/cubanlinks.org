<p><a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001819.html">Jeremy is getting a new Powerbook</a>.  And dammit, I want one too!
<br/><br/>
<a href="http://www.proteus.com">The company I used to work for</a> was a bastion of Apple goodness.  Even a year later, I still miss my old-school black PowerBook.  As hard as I&#8217;ve tried, my Dell Latutude simply hasn&#8217;t grown on me.  How they remain so firmly extrenched at number 1 is a mystery to me.
<br/><br/>
Of course, the minute I realize I&#8217;d have to throw down <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore?family=PowerBook">over 2 g&#8217;s for a new PowerBook</a>, I calm down.  I spent 2 plus weeks traveling around southeast Asia for around $2k, so I&#8217;m not sure that iPhoto can really compete with that.  I guess I&#8217;ll just have to wait until my 3 1/2 year old PC starts to make some wheezing noises.</p>
