<p>I&#8217;ve upgraded to <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac/">Typo</a>, a blogging tool written in Ruby on Rails. Writing and maintaining my own <a href="http://cubanlinks.org/mywiki/Conte">blogging tool</a> was a great opportunity for me to teach myself Spring and Hibernate, as well as increase my overall <span class="caps">J2EE</span>/webapp skills,  but the cost of keeping this tool up-to-date eventually became too high, and I could no longer keep up with things like comment spam, blacklists, etc.</p>


<p>I&#8217;ll discuss more about the upgrade later.  I&#8217;m also in the process of creating a new theme, so bear with this vanilla look.</p>


<p>At the end of the day, I really hope using Typo (or any other tool in the same class) will make writing so effortless that I can plug myself back into the conversation known as the blogosphere (not a term I like, but you get the picture).</p>
