<p>After <a href="http://cubanlinks.org/articles/2008/5/5/adobe-air-resource-hog">having some problems</a> with Twirl and AlertThingy, I think I&#8217;m going to stick with the FriendFeed web app for now.  Isn&#8217;t that strange?  Shouldn&#8217;t desktop clients be so much more responsive?  Shouldn&#8217;t they be able to provide a richer UI?  And yet, I find the FF website to be a) more up-to-date and b) more responsive to my clicks and scrolls.</p>


<p>One thing that I <strong>still</strong> don&#8217;t understand is the ordering of entries.  Look at my screenshot.  Those were all loaded at the exact same time.  Can anyone explain this ordering?</p>
