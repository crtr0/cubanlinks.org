<p>I moved into my new apartment on March 15th.  My original date for the installation of my phone line was March 17th.  By the time I picked up a phone and got a dial tone it was <b>April 1st</b>.
<br/><br/>
While that might not sound <u>so</u> bad, you first need to understand the constant stream of bullshit that I got for their CSRs.  Every day I would call and inquire to the status of my order.  <span class="caps">EVERY DAY</span>, I would be told the same thing: <i>We&#8217;re sending someone out [this evening,tomorrow morning].</i>  The next day would come, there would be no dial tone, and I would call back and repeat the process.  It became a running joke in my apartment and at work.
<br/><br/>
Eventually I flipped out and demanded to speak to a manager on Monday, March 31st.  This was a day after I got a voice-mail on my cell phone from an Verizon cable tech telling me: <i>There are problems with the lines.  Blah blah.  We fix the issues, and have your service on in 24 hours.</i>  So, the <span class="caps">CSR</span> tells me no manager is available at the moment, but she&#8217;ll have one return my call by 7pm.  7:01pm rolls around and I call back.  By some chance I get the same lady.  She recognizes me and puts me through to a manager.  I <em>strongly</em> voice my displeasure, and he explains to me they&#8217;re doing the best they can, etc.  He promises to have someone out the next day.
<br/><br/>
I got home from work yesterday and, purely out of habit, checked to see if there was a dial tone.  Indeed there was!  Of course, the hilarious part is that I still need to get <span class="caps">DSL</span>.  I&#8217;d say the over/under on that would be June 1st.</p>
