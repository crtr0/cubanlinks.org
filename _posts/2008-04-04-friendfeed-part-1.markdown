<p><a href="http://twitter.com/efliv/statuses/783024476">Eddie asked</a>, so I&#8217;ll try to explain why (I think) I love <a href="http://www.friendfeed.com">FriendFeed</a>.</p>


<p><strong>It Help Define Me</strong></p>


<p>My activities on-line span multiple websites and services.  Some of these activities are private, but many others are ripe for sharing.  We&#8217;re social creatures and we want others to know what we think about the world and what we&#8217;re up to.  Websites have wised up to this need to share and have adopted <span class="caps">RSS</span> as a baseline method of publishing this information.  Most importantly (for non-programmers) many sites provide snippets of code that can be embedded on your website/blog to share this information in a more digestible format.</p>


<p>So, this was fine, until I ended up with more and more badges cluttering my blog.  They were generally formatted differently from one another, and rather than having a &#8220;river&#8221; of updates, I had one block for Twitter, one block for Flickr, and so on.  FriendFeed aggregates these updates and publishes them in a nice, coherent time-line.  It understands the purpose of each service, and presents the information appropriately.  Frankly, I can almost see this feed (if properly formatted) completely replacing my blog.</p>


<p><strong>It Help Me Keep Track of You</strong></p>


<p>The same principle applies for my friends.  I had the option of subscribing to their delicious feeds, their Flickr feeds, and so on.  Sometimes the services themselves would provide some help (Flickr will let me subscribe to <span class="caps">ALL</span> my contacts in one motion), but this still proved to be a frustrating and error-prone way to keep up to date.  Now, I can subscribe to my friends&#8217; FriendFeeds and be automatically updated on any new services they add or discontinue.</p>
