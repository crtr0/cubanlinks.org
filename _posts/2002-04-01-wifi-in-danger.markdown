<p>In the Marketplace of today&#8217;s Wall Street Journal, there is an article about the potential collision of WiFi (80211.b) and satellite radio technologies.  Apparently, both utilize spectrum bands that are close enough to each other to cause interference.  The main players in satellite radio, <a href="http://www.xmradio.com/">XM</a> and <a href="http://www.siriusradio.com">Sirius</a>, have asked the <span class="caps">FCC</span> to clamp down on <a href="http://80211b.weblogger.com/">80211.b</a> and enforce tougher standards on their products in order to eliminate interference.  WiFi advocates say that their devices meet current <span class="caps">FCC</span> regs, and that the XM and Sirius should have designed their products with these issues in mind.</p>
