<p>I have <i>huge amounts</i> of old mail from my old email server that I have been unable to load into my new email server.  Long story short, I haven&#8217;t been able to use Cyrdeliver to route email to a specific subfolder.  It will only go to the inbox (root folder).</p><p>Recently, I&#8217;ve stumbled upon <a href="http://www.marklyon.org/gmail/default.htm">Mark Lyon&#8217;s GMail Loader</a> and almost fainted.  This is freaking amazing.  I&#8217;m going to go home and load these emails into GMail tonight.  If you have a GMail account, you should also check out <a href="http://www.marklyon.org/gmail/gmailapps.htm">all these other cool hacks</a>.</p>
