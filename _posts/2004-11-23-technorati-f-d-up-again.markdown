<p>Anyone getting Technorati to work for them?  According to them, I have no claimed weblogs, and the <span class="caps">URL</span> &#8220;http://cubanlinks.org/blog&#8221; appears nowhere in their system.  Incidentally, neither does &#8220;http://www.chrishalverson.com/&#8221; or &#8220;http://www.pokergrub.com&#8221;.  Sigh.  I was really hoping these guys would become the Google of the blogging world.  But the service has been flaky (not updating my rankings, etc) for <i>months</i> and now seems flat-out crippled.  I think its time for someone to step into that space with a service as reliable as most other web-apps we all rely on.</p>
