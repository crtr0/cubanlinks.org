<p>A while back I was introduced to the concept of <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/email/merlin-mann-presents-inbox-zero-282544.php">inbox zero</a>. It was simultaneously an obvious and insightful concept, completely changing how I treat email.  I use GMail, and it had never occurred to me what the purpose of the &#8220;archive&#8221; button was.  I simply left all emails in my inbox and starred those that required attention.  Of course, starred messages would soon dribble down and off the first page, and I would have to remember to click the &#8220;starred view&#8221; to bring these emails back to attention. Today, I have maybe <strong>20 emails</strong> in my inbox (and this is still probably too many).  I have the most urgent emails starred.</p>


<p>This philosophy of processing email is very similar to the mindset behind consuming a <a href="http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/riverOfNews">river of news</a>.  The idea being that one way to consume news (or <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds) is as a single stream of posts.  I was talking to <a href="http://www.attentionbandit.com">Eddie</a> the other day about his obsession with not missing posts.  He is very methodical about how he reads his feeds.  I tried to convince him that this was a <strong>waste of time</strong>.  The time savings and stress relief that comes from readings what&#8217;s in front of you at the moment, rather than worrying about a post you might missed from a few days ago, is huge.  And if something is <strong>truly important</strong> it will continue to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber">echo</a> throughout the blogosphere.</p>


<p>And finally, this doesn&#8217;t end with email and news.  It applies to Twitter messages, Flickr uploads, Facebook updates, you name it.  I think the services that allow us to process this information as a stream of notifications (think chat) and remove the stress of missing something will be the services that succeed. Life is a river and sometimes you just have to sit back and enjoy the view.</p>
