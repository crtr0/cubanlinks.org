<p><a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/">Dave Sifry</a> (founder and <span class="caps">CEO</span> of <a href="http://www.technorati.com">Technorati</a>) dropped by yesterday to comment on a post I wrote on some of my <a href="/blog/post/2004/11/23/Technorati-F-d-Up-<del>again</del>.html#permalink&#8221;&gt;latest frustrations using his company&#8217;s service.  This isn&#8217;t the first time <a href="/blog/post/2004/08/26/Technora---Core-Dump.html#permalink">he&#8217;s done this</a>, but I&#8217;m still amazed when it happens.</p>
<p>He apologized for any problems I was experiencing, but also pointed out that the service seemed to be functioning correctly.  Naturally, I checked, and indeed things seem to be back up.  Must have been a temporary outage.</p>
<p>In any case, I appreciate the amount of work Dave is obviously putting forth on behalf of his users.  It&#8217;s just that in the age of Google and other hyper-architected systems the stakes and expectations are raised for everyone involved in trying to build a customer base.</p>
<p>Moving forward, I thought I&#8217;d use this space to address a couple of issues that I&#8217;m still having with the service.  I&#8217;m sure this feedback (assuming its shared in the vast aggregate of the Net) will find its way to the development team.</p>
<p>1. Currently, my cosmos search says that I have <i>260 links from 32 sources</i>.  However, my claimed weblog summary states that I have <i>Inbound blogs: 16 Rank: 63524  </i>.  Is that an inconsistency, or is there a difference between a <b>source</b> and an <b>inbound blog</b>?</p>
<p>2. When running a cosmos search on myself, I notice that most of the 260 links are from <b>me</b>.  I think I&#8217;d prefer if Technorati didn&#8217;t count self-referrential links.</p>
<p>3. Hitting the &#8220;next&#8221; button should more or less instantly show me the next page of results.  Sitting through the &#8220;searching&#8230;&#8221; screen is not something you&#8217;d expect to have to do and is discouraging.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s it for now.  Hope you find this feedback helpful in improving the service, Dave.  Best wishes for the holidays.</p>
