<p>I sent my friend Sarah a perma-link to a post I wrote about the war.  It was easier than explaining how I felt over IM.  Much to my dismay, she told me she got an error page when she clicked on the link.  After some investigation, I discovered I was improperly <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html" title="SimpleDateFormat object in Java">formatting the date</a>.
<br/><br/>
This:<br/><br/>
<code>
private final SimpleDateFormat datetime =
    new SimpleDateFormat("M/d/yyyy hh:mm");
</code>
<br/><br/>
... became this:<br/><br/>
<code>
private final SimpleDateFormat datetime =
    new SimpleDateFormat("M/d/yyyy HH:mm");
</code>
<br/><br/>
Notice the uppercase H&#8217;s in the bottom.  Lower case mean the hour is treated as 0-12.  Uppercase means the hour is treated as 0-23. God, I hate those type of bugs.</p>
