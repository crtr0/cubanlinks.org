<p><a href="http://www.techliberation.com/archives/014434.php">Suberb essay</a> over at <a href="http://www.techliberation.com">The Technology Liberation Front</a> dissecting articles from <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.09/view.html?pg=5">Larry Lessig</a> and <a href="http://www.thenewatlantis.com/archive/6/jrosen.htm">Jeffrey Rosen</a> about obscenity on the Internet.  I left a little comment, less to add my own thoughts, but more to refute someone else&#8217;s.  Nice guy I am, right?  After reading these essays, I&#8217;m flabbergasted.  The word &#8220;filter&#8221; came up 12 times in this essay, with all kind of First Amendment implications being discussed.  You&#8217;ve got to be kidding me, right?  Filters are <b>optional</b>!  I don&#8217;t use a filter.  No one <i>has</i> to use a filter.  So how&#8217;d this become a central part of the discussion?</p>
