<p>It was too good to last.  The idea that a company like Google could go from zero to hero and stay true to what got them there.  But money (and investors and management and PR people and&#8230;) talks and then next thing you know <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/11/google-watcher">Google is speaking legalese and covering their asses</a> with the best of them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll think I&#8217;m blowing this out of proportion, but I don&#8217;t think so.  This is a trend I&#8217;ve been noticing, from booting people from their AdSense program without cause to trying to quash <span class="caps">RSS</span> with Atom. Google is forgetting about what got them to the table, and how fickle a user base can be.  If it turns out that AllTheWeb.com (or anything coming from Microsoft or the open source community) is better, I&#8217;ll switch in a heartbeat.  Why wouldn&#8217;t I?  Google has no lock-in.</p>
