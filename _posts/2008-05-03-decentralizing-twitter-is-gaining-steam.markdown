<p>It seems like <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/05/03/microbloggingShouldBeDecen.html">Dave Winer</a> is coming around.  So is <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/RFCOpenTweetsWhyIsMicrobloggingCentralized.aspx">Scott Hanselman</a>.  It seems like people are in agreement that the real barrier relates to Twitter&#8217;s value-adds:</p>


<ul>
<li>Follower/Following tracking</li>
	<li><span class="caps">SMS</span> notifications</li>
</ul>


<p>There are many different ways to skin this cat, but I like that people are starting to realize that centralizing micro-blogging makes about as much sense as centralizing regular blogging.  That is, not at all.</p>
