Now that v0.3 of FF2Disqus is in private-beta, I thought I'd put up a page to answer basic some questions about the application and record feedback.  Please check-out the example above of how a typical sync works.  If you have any questions or comments, please leave them in the comments.

<strong>Ping Response</strong>

FF2Disqus provides users the ability to ping a URL to initiate a sync.  We automatically run syncs once an hour, but some people aren't that patient. :) The format of the response is <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a>.  The response object has the following attributes:
<ul>
<li>success: true or false</li>
<li>errorCode (optional): is success is false, this provides a short code explanation (invalid-user/time-out/unknown-error)</li>
<li>message: if success is true this is an array of comments that were synced, else a longer explanation of the error</li>
</ul>
