<p>So, a couple days ago I wrote about <a href="http://cubanlinks.org/blog/articles/2006/11/28/flirting-with-new-hosts">flirting with new hosting providers</a>. For reasons that are hazy, I thought DreamHost would be a good provider to check-out and compare to the service I&#8217;m currently receiving from <span class="sponsor"><a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=69506&#38;U=192330&#38;M=10198">TextDrive</a></span>. At first blush, I was very happy with what I saw from DH, including a <strong>very</strong> complete web admin console. I was able to set-up domains/users/email easily. There were tabs for managing your billing, <span class="caps">DNS</span>, 1-click installs and other goodies. I was impressed.</p>


<p>These feelings rapidly vanished over the course of the next 2-3 days. My main impetus for obtaining a new hosting provider was to set-up a hosting environment for <a href="http://briancartenuto.com">briancartenuto.com</a>, the website of a buddy of mine who is an executive chef. He&#8217;s currently slumming on a cheapo GoDaddy host, and I wanted to set-up a <a href="http://mephistoblog.com">Mephisto</a> CMS for him to better manage his on-line presence.</p>


<p>I then spent the better part of 2 days trying to get Mephisto (and later <a href="http://www.typosphere.org">Typo 4</a>) trying to run on DH using FastCGI.  First of all, Apache+FastCGI isn&#8217;t even the best option for Rails deployment (see Lighttpd, Mongrel, etc), but it&#8217;s all they &#8220;offered&#8221; so I&#8217;ll take it. Despite following <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=dreamhost+rails+fastcgi&#38;ie=utf-8&#38;oe=utf-8&#38;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&#38;client=firefox-a">every possible set of instructions</a> for getting things set-up properly, I failed to get either application up-and-running. I submitted a support ticket, waited 24 hours plus, and nothing. I am by no means a newbie when it comes to *nix/Apache/Ruby/etc and I simply couldn&#8217;t get things to work. So long Dreamhost, it was nice knowing you.</p>


<p>All of which has made me appreciate <span class="sponsor"><a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=69506&#38;U=192330&#38;M=10198">TextDrive</a></span> a great deal more. TextDrive is in the process of re-defining a new set of hosting plans in conjunction with bundling services from their sister companies <span class="sponsor"><a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=57232&#38;U=192330&#38;M=10198">Joyent</a></span> and <span class="sponsor"><a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=69507&#38;U=192330&#38;M=10198">Strongspace</a></span>. It&#8217;s possible that some of these improvements might alleviate some of the limitations/problems I&#8217;ve had, so we&#8217;ll have to wait-and-see. Thanks to <a href="http://lindsay.at/blog">Adam Lindsay</a> for cluing me in to some excellent forum scuttlebut referring to the future of TextDrive and their plans.</p>


<p>Still, I am very much in the market for alternative hosts, even if all my TxD issues were to be resolved. I don&#8217;t like the idea of putting all my eggs in any one basket. An email to the <a href="http://www.rubydc.org">RubyDC</a> elicited the following suggestions that I will be checking out:</p>
