<p>I am making a temporary switch to <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">FeedBurner</a> as I try to untangle the issues with my <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed.  With a simple Lighttpd redirect, all requests for /blog/feed (that are not coming from the FeedBurner bot) will be redirected to <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/cubanlinks">feeds.feedburner.com/cubanlinks</a>.  I have resisted handing over control of my <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed to a third party, but given everything else we surrender these days (links, photos, videos, etc) what&#8217;s the point of resisting?</p>
