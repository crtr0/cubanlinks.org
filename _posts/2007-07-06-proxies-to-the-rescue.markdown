<p>Ok, at this point I&#8217;ve now noticed at least 2 &#8220;applications&#8221; for the iPhone that require the user to set-up some sort of proxy:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.vetton.ruwww.tuaw.com/2007/07/06/irc-on-iphone/"><span class="caps">IRC</span> on the iPhone</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.vetton.ruwww.tuaw.com/2007/07/06/ssh-shell-for-iphone/"><span class="caps">SSH</span> for the iPhone</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Both applications require you to install software on your home computer (which must be connected to the Internet).  Running these proxies will open up a port on your home computer (which must be exempted from any firewall you might have) so that you might hit http://yourIPaddress:port/whatever from your iPhone.</p>


<p>Besides the security implications of opening up these ports and running this code, is this really even necessary?  I&#8217;ve long wondered why some enterprising company didn&#8217;t offer free web-enabled <span class="caps">SSH</span> (hosted on <strong>their</strong> servers and on port 80).  As a consultant working at a client&#8217;s site behind firewalls, I would have given my pinky toe for something like this on numerous occasions.  So, time for someone to step up?  Can it be that hard?</p>
