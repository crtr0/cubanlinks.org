<p>After <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/sixapart_ties_it_all_together.php">reading about BlogIt</a> I am convinced that this service will <strong>ruin my life</strong>.  Why you might ask?  Because it empowers people to type up a simple post:</p>


<blockquote>
My, what a beautiful day it is.  La dee da dee da!
</blockquote>

<p>...and blast this out to a <strong>multitude of different</strong> services (their blog, Twitter, Pownce, etc).  Which is fine, presuming that friends follow their other friends on a purely one-to-one basis (i.e. I follow <a href="http://twitter.com/efliv">Eddie</a> exclusively through Twitter).</p>


<p><strong>But I don&#8217;t!</strong>  I follow Eddie via Twitter, his blog and any other service he exposes on <a href="http://friendfeed.com/efliv">his FriendFeed</a>.  The idea of him cross-posting a single post to multiple services and having all of those duplicates end-up in my stream makes me want to claw my eyes out!  So, please, let&#8217;s take a stand now on cross-posting.  It&#8217;s a <span class="caps">BAD IDEA</span>.</p>
