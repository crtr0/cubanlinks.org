I was having lunch with my sister Caroline a few months ago in San Francisco. We were eating not far from my company's offices in SOMA. I really love seeing my sister. We were never close growing up. Sometimes I think I'm trying to make up for 30 years of lost time in every meal we share. 

I told her about a letter I was going to write to my father. It was going to be a very *serious* letter, wherein I would tell him things that somehow I had trouble expressing to his face. I was going to share my feelings about some of his choices, how they were hurting those that he loved and how he had better start to live in the moment because he couldn't be sure how much time he had left. You see, my father was very ill. He had been diagnosed with cancer in the summer of 2015 and underwent surgery in December of that year. He seemed to be doing great immediately following the procedure, but no sooner had I flown back to Seattle then he started having complications that eventually saw him end up in a state of non-stop sedation and on life support. I flew back to Washington, DC several times over the next few months, each time thinking "this might be it". 

But against all odds, his lungs got stronger and he was eventually healthy enough to go home. Of course, he wasn't out of the woods. He was terribly ill and was combating both cancer and a set of lungs that were still quite damaged from several bouts of pneumonia. But even in his battered state, he would talk to me about invitations that he had receieved to speak at conferences and his desire to get better so that he could get back to work. 

I hated to hear these things. When I saw him last he was still in the hospital, a few weeks before he was eventually able to go home. He had his work laptop open in front of him, an ancient and absolutely massive Macbook Pro. I remember thinking what a joke it was that they didn't issue him something lighter and easier to travel with, like a Macbook Air. The hospital had Wi-Fi, so he would connect to the Internet, connect to his company's VPN, and then spend hours scanning his work email. I vividly remember thinking to myself how utterly insane it was that my father was even remotely thinking about work. I would have connected to the VPN just long enough to resign. 

But my father loved his work. And he was an eternal optimist. He always thought that things were going to work out, that he would always have enough time. Sometimes he was wrong, and he'd show up late to a dinner party, apologizing to his hosts with a giant grin on his face while telling a vivid story of traffic, a missed exit and a wrong address. The tardiness would be forgotten and everyone would sit back and experience a classic Angel Rabasa story, full of roaring laughter, his face turning red and tears streaming down the eyes of everyone lucky enough to be there.

I never did send that letter. In fact, I hadn't even written it yet. I think I was planning to write it on my flight to DC in a few weeks. I had already started to think about what kind of stationary I was going to use. It needed to be handwritten of course, because it was serious. I was going to tell him how much I loved him, how much I missed him, how much I wished that he'd write to us, tell us how we was doing, tell us the truth and stop with the polite Skype calls where we would talk about anything, anything at all, except the things that might actually matter in life. 

Yesterday on Sunday September 25th 2016 my father, Angel Miguel Rabasa, passed away. He was surrounded by many of his loved ones. But I wasn't there. My stepmother called my this past Saturday, urging me to come out soon. I was sure he wasn't that bad and that I would have plenty of time to see him. After all, I was flying out in *just two weeks* for my high school 20th reunion. Even when I got the call on Sunday morning and was told that he had been admitted to the hospital and was in declining health, I figured there would be time. We booked the entire family on the first flight out of Seattle and I fully expcted to get to the hospital and see my father surrounded by loved ones and in decent spirits. But I am my father's son and I was too late.
