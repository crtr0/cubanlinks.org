title: Sweet 10k Apart Web Apps
---
I've been checking out the cool web apps being entered into the <a href="http://10k.aneventapart.com/">10k Apart Contest</a> and found one that I just love.  It's called <a href="http://10k.aneventapart.com/Uploads/330/">FotoTable </a>and hooks into Flickr to create a virtual desktop of scattered and stacked photos.  It doesn't *do* a ton, but when you couple it with cute pictures of my baby daughter <a href="http://catherine.rabasa.com">Catherine </a>some serious eye candy is created.  And all in less than 10k of code!
