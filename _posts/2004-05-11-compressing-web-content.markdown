<p>Linux Journal has a great article on <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6802">compressing the content served by Apache</a>.  Since the vast majority of content being served is text (HTML, <span class="caps">XML</span>, etc) compression makes a lot of sense.  Lower bandwidth, quicker downloads, the works.  The real trick is to find the sweet spot between the level of compression and the amount of <span class="caps">CPU</span> you sacrifice to handle it.  Once my new server is up and running (courtesy of Taurus) I will implement this <span class="caps">ASAP</span>.</p>
