<p>I have been looking into setting up an <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~dirsvcs/ldap/"><span class="caps">LDAP</span><a/> server.  I think it would be nice to place all of my contact list information in one place, and have that repository be accessible over the internet.  I&#8217;ve heard good things about <a href="http://openldap.org">OpenLDAP</a>, so I downloaded and built it.
<br/><br/>
Now, I&#8217;m pulling my hair out trying to get it to work.  It&#8217;s dawning on me why <span class="caps">LDAP</span> hasn&#8217;t exactly set the world on fire.  If anyone has done anything similar to what I&#8217;m trying to do (which has to be the most common use of <span class="caps">LDAP</span> in the world) tips would be appreciated.
<br/><br/>
Lastly, I was excited to find out that the guys at <a href="http://www.novell.com">Novell</a> had created a Java interface into <span class="caps">LDAP</span>, <a href="http://www.openldap.org/jldap/"><span class="caps">JLDAP</span></a>.  This was good news for me because it allows me to use my contact information for other cool/programmatic things (mailing lists, etc).</p>
