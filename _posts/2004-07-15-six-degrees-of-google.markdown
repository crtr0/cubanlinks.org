<p><a href="http://www.touchgraph.com/TGGoogleBrowser.html">This tool is freaking cool</a>.  It let&#8217;s you enter in a domain (cubanlinks.org, etc) and see visually (warning: needs Java) the relationship between the sites you link to, the sites that link to you, etc.  Very cool.  <a href="http://dave.dontpokeme.com/poker/index.php/archives/2004/07/15/poker-blog-web-thingy/"><i>[via David]</i></a></p>
