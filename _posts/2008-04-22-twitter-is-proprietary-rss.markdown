<p>So, it seems that <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/080421/p92#a080421p92">Twitter has been down lately</a>.  <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/04/20/aNewKindOfTwitterOutage.html">There has</a> been <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/04/21/theTwitterOutagePersists.html">a lot</a> of <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/04/21/aNewStrategyForTwitterOuta.html">hand-wringing</a> about what is <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/04/21/twitter-grabbing-defeat-from-the-jaws-of-success/">to be done</a>.  A lot of people have come around on the Twitter phenomenon, and I think I know why:</p>


<p><strong>Twitter is proprietary <span class="caps">RSS</span></strong></p>


<p>What does Twitter do?  It allows me to blog and to subscribe to other bloggers.  It provides an interface that combines reading and writing.  The other stuff (micro-limits, <span class="caps">SMS</span>, API) are the candy on top.  But at it&#8217;s core, Twitter is just a nicely packaged blogging tool and blog reader that provides programmatic &#8220;awareness&#8221; of who is subscribed to you (as opposed to just who you are subscribed to).</p>


<p>Here&#8217;s a thought experiment:  What if I could mash my <span class="caps">RSS</span> reader (Google Reader) with my blogging tool (Mephisto)?  What if Mephisto (and all compliant blogging tools) supported a simple <span class="caps">API</span> to accept a ping indicating that someone has subscribed to my feed?  So, I subscribe to Bob&#8217;s feed, my reader send his blog a ping, and he now knows that he&#8217;s being &#8220;followed&#8221;.  It&#8217;s this precisely what a <strong>distributed Twitter</strong> would be?</p>
