<p>Next time someone labels me a music download <em>pirate</em> (are you listening <span class="caps">RIAA</span>??), I&#8217;ll just whip out my credit card bill which should have a <b>$0.99</b> line item for the download of &#8220;Cortez the Killer&#8221; by Neil Young.  How did I come to this purchase?  By looking at the &#8220;celebrity&#8221; playlist set-up by Billy Corgan, of Smashing Pumpkin fame.
<br/><br/>
So, sure, I still have a couple hundred downloaded songs, but this is a promising start.  I can&#8217;t wait to get home and stick this song on my iPod.</p>
