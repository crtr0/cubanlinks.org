<p>AlertThingy purports to retrieve incoming Tweets from your friends if you check a box in the Twitter config (see above).  However, this feature is not working for me and doesn&#8217;t seem to be working for <a href="http://twitter.com/galtroarc/statuses/797309095">other</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/ccarella/statuses/803422300">people</a> as well.</p>


<p>FriendFeed does not aggregate Twitter information about those you follow.  That would require authentication via the Twitter <span class="caps">API</span>, and FF only asks for your credentials if you have protected updates.</p>


<p>So, the only way that I see this feature working would require AlertThingy to retrieve your following list from Twitter and then retrieve status updates for each user.  Which should all be possible (if not terribly elegant).  So why does it seem like this feature isn&#8217;t working?</p>
