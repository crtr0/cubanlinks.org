<p>You may (or may not) notice a slight re-vamping to my site.  Under the hood, I&#8217;ve re-written and re-factored just about every line of code.  The most signifact change is that I am now using <a href="http://www.hibernate.org">Hibernate</a> to interface with my database.  Once I get the code cleaned up to my liking, I will post the source on this site.
<br/><br/>
There are some changes that you should notice:<br/>
<ul>
<li>The list of blogs on the right is now powered by <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a>, and is seperated by category.</li>
<li>The URLs now have extensions (.html and .xml).  These extensions determine whether to render the page as <span class="caps">HTML</span> or as <span class="caps">RSS</span>.  So, just about every page on my blog is now also an <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed.  If you only care about when I write about <a href="/section/Poker.html">poker</a>, then subscribe to <a href="/section/Poker.xml">poker <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed</a>.</li>
<li>I am in the process of adding Trackback support.  Should be in sometime this week.</li>
<li>Cosmetic changes have been made. Bueno?</li>
</ul>
Feed back is always welcome and appreciated.</p>
