&raquo; Cross-posted from [http://cubanlinks.org/2006/11/30/referral-links-web-ethics-etc](http://cubanlinks.org/2006/11/30/referral-links-web-ethics-etc) &laquo;

<p>In <a href="http://cubanlinks.org/blog/articles/2006/11/29/slapped-in-the-face">my last post</a> I discussed some of the hosting services that I&#8217;ve been examining. A few of the links (TextDrive, Joyent, Strongspace) contain referral id&#8217;s. Any click on these <span class="caps">URL</span>&#8217;s that lead to a sale generate a small commission for me.</p>


<p>I don&#8217;t expect big things from these referrals, but you never know. If I&#8217;m happy with a service and someone who reads this blog ends up choosing that service for their own use, I see a referral fee as a win-win. The obvious exception to this rule is the temptation to blindly refer services/products that you can&#8217;t/don&#8217;t vouch for just for the commission. I don&#8217;t think I would ever do this, given the poor trade-off between sacrificing what small bit of credibility that I have and the meager amount of income that I would generate.  The poker links on the right follow the same mold: these are sites and/or services that I actually use.</p>


<p>Now, to the point of this post. Any links that I include in-text (there was an interesting article in the Wall Street Journal about this the other day) will be marked with a double-underline. This will differentiate <span class="sponsor"><a href="#">sponsored links</a></span> from <a href="#">normal links</a>. I think the double-underline is somewhat of an industry standard, so I&#8217;m happy to go with it. Once again, this is all moot given my traffic, but the same principles will probably be used on <a href="http://dckickball.org/blog">DCKickball&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>
