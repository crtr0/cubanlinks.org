<p>I just installed <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant">Ant</a> and very happy with what I&#8217;m seeing so far.  Java and <span class="caps">XML</span> make sure a <b>lovely pair</b>, and using them to build my project is great.

For those that don&#8217;t know, Ant is a <em>build tool</em>, similar to make.  You use it to take a set of source files on convert them into something useful (class files, JARs, JavaDocs, etc).  At the moment, I have Ant set up to do a build of my entire source heirarchy and generate the appropriate JavaDoc <a href="/api">files</a>.</p>
