<p>I&#8217;m still speechless at the news.  <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> has opened up their repository of over 2 billion webpages for searching to any developer who&#8217;s language of choice speaks <a href="http://www.soapware.org"><span class="caps">SOAP</span></a>.  All you have to do is read the specs for their <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/"><span class="caps">API</span>&#8217;s</a>.  I can&#8217;t even begin to think of the cool things that are possible now.  I&#8217;m even too stunned to take a cynical look at what Google expects to get out of this&#8230;.</p>
