<p>I&#8217;ll go out on a limb here: the current debate over the future of the Google Toolbar&#8217;s AutoLink feature is possibly one of the most important debates in the history of the Internet.  Two sides have sprung up in this debate.  Those <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20050225/1226205_F.shtml">who advocate</a> for <a href="http://cheerleader.yoz.com/archives/001927.html">the right</a> to use a product like the Google Toolbar to rip/mix/burn the content they obtain from the Internet and those who <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0205f.shtml">oppose</a> <a href="http://www.thetwowayweb.com/2005/02/22#a272">the manipulation</a> of <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/02/27.html#a9484">the sanctity</a> of hyperlinks.</p>
<p>Honestly, I came to a very rapid conclusion on this one: I&#8217;m against the manipulation (or addition) of links.  Why?  Think about what the World Wide Web <i>is</i> and what makes it so special.</p>
<p>Is it <span class="caps">DIV</span> tags.  Is it <span class="caps">TABLE</span> structures?  Is it IMaGes? No, it&#8217;s links.  Hyper-links. <u>H&lt;/u&gt;yper <u>T&lt;/u&gt;ext <u>T&lt;/u&gt;ransfer <u>P&lt;/u&gt;rotocol.  Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML).  The linked nature of the documents that populate the Internet are what make the Web <i>work</i>.  The number of links, and their relevance is what allows Google to earn billions of dollars a year.  Besides the plain-text editorial content of a given page, the links are the single most important component.</p>
<p>So, my point is that links are sacrosant in ways that other markup isn&#8217;t.  Some of the pro-rip/mix/burn crowd might think that this is an illogical stance and that all markup should be considered equal.  I think these people are simply getting stuck in the trap of an &#8220;all-or-nothing&#8221; argument.  Either you can modify content (in any way you see fit) or you can&#8217;t.  Personally, I don&#8217;t buy in to that.</p>
<p>This debate is important because it is a slippery slope.  Once content modification is blessed by the masses, you&#8217;ve broken the web.  You&#8217;ve snubbed your nose at producers of content in order to grossly over-empower consumers, and an important balance is disrupted.  Ask yourself why people/organizations/companies would spend vast amount of time and money to produce content whose inherent message and qualities can be rearranged on the fly?  Where does it end?</p>
