<p>Lately, there&#8217;s been a lot of talk about <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/dickerson/2004/07/20.html#15.12.57"><span class="caps">RSS</span> and the growing pains it&#8217;s having</a>.  The idea being that if a website (http://foo.org) has a popular <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed (http://foo.org/rss.xml), it may buckle under the pressure of so many requests for its feed.  This problem differs from &#8220;typical&#8221; Internet load issues in that most <span class="caps">RSS</span> aggregators are configured to download feeds at <a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2004/07/more_on_rss_ban.html">regular intervals</a> (on the hour, every two hours, etc) and the aggregation of this creates a tsunami of requests in a short period of time.</p><p>While there are <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2004/07/21/Getting-the-Word-Out">solutions out there</a>, I haven&#8217;t heard anyone mention the new kid on the block: BitTorrent.  Isn&#8217;t this exactly what BitTorrent is good for?  Every aggregator fetching http://foo.org/rss.xml would help share the burden of distributing this file.  And since so many aggregators can be counted on to hit this file <b>at the same time</b> the very property (timing) that is causing so many problem to webservers everywhere would instead be its <b>biggest asset</b>.  Am I crazy?</p>
