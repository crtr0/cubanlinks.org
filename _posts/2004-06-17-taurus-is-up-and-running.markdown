<p>Those of you who are subscribed to any of the mailing lists I manage (kickball, poker, etc) may have noticed things amiss yesterday.  This was due to a not-so-seamless migration of my email and email-services from my old machine (rome.cubanlinks.org, <span class="caps">PII</span> box) to my new machine (taurus.cubanlinks.org, <span class="caps">PIII</span> box) which was donated by, and thus christened after, Taurus.</p>
<p>Anyway, things seem to be fixed at the moment, and I thought I&#8217;d describe some of the upgrades associated with my migration.</p>
