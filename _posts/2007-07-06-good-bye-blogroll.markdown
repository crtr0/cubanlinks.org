<p>I used to have a blogroll located on the right side of this blog.  The roll was powered by Bloglines, my old on-line <span class="caps">RSS</span> reader.  I have since switched to Google Reader and haven&#8217;t looked back.  I love using it on my laptop and I <strong>especially</strong> love using it on the iPhone.  So, as I&#8217;ve added and pruned blogs from Reader, the old blogroll on Bloglines had grown out of date.  So, poof, it&#8217;s gone.</p>


<p>In its place is Google&#8217;s concept of shared posts.  The idea is simple: as I am reading posts in Google&#8217;s Reader I can flag posts of interest to share.  These shared posts show up automatically in the &#8220;Shared Posts&#8221; section to the right.  Instead of having a static list of sites that I read, I now have a more dynamic (and relevant) list of post that I found to be interesting.</p>
