<p>This stands for the <a href="http://www.ccurisa.org/?q=node/62">Adams Morgan Ruby Users Group</a>.  I&#8217;ve been asked to stop by their next meeting this Sunday at 3pm and spend 10 minutes talking about my experiences building RoR apps for     DCKickball.  Should be interesting.  I&#8217;ve never been much into the &#8220;user group&#8221; scene, which is odd because I consider myself to be a pretty social person.</p>
