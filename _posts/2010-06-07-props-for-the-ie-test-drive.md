From a [recent Webmonkey post](http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/06/apples-html5-showcase-less-about-web-standards-more-about-apple/) about Apple's decision to block non-Safari browsers from their HTML5 demos:

> Microsoft recently published [its own HTML5 showcase](http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/) to hype the coming release of Internet Explorer 9, and its demo pages are viewable (and work) in any non-IE browser with the proper support. Mozilla's [HTML5 demo pages](http://hacks.mozilla.org/category/demo/featured-demo/) are geared to work with experimental builds of Firefox, but at least other browsers aren't blocked, and most of the demos actually work in Chrome.
