<pre><code>Transmitting file data ...............
Committed revision 200.</code></pre>

<p>I don&#8217;t expect most people to know what this means, but I have commited (via Subversion) the 200th revision of the code base that powers <a href="http://dcksports.com"><span class="caps">DCK</span> Sports</a>.  I&#8217;ve been working on this code for since the winter of 2005/2006 and it&#8217;s gone through quite an evolution.  I&#8217;m actually quite terrified of what is going to happen once I cede control of maintaining this code (as might happen if <span class="caps">DCK</span> Sports continues to grow and/or my programming skills continue to petrify).  Either way, quite a milestone for me!</p>
